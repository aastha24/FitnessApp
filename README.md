**BOSTON UNIVERSITY: EC601 Product Design**

# About FitGo
It is Macronutrition brought to the masses. We talk Nutrition and Fitness. 
Its an application which allows you to make your own profile - login through facebook, calculate your macros (Protein,fats and carbs) and calories by providing information about yourself to our calculator (Male/Female) and we allow YOU to decide what YOU want in your meals for the day. 

So you can choose to: Lose weight/Gain weight or Maintain your weight
Whatever you decide, we let you achieve
And as long as your food matches your macros its in your "diet" ;)

You can view the application at: (http://ec2-54-187-168-33.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/)
For now the application is in the development mode and you will not be provided the capability to login through facebook. (In case you want to login and use the app - give us a mail we might add you in)
